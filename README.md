# NetID

# background
This is the C# final project for the C# workshop at my school. 

# enduration
C# workshop took place every Saturday afternoon for 5 hours. 

# challenge
I used Java more than C#, so I did think in terms of java when I want to read a line.

# future
I programmed using the vim editor on the command line. Need an user friendly and good looking GUI.
