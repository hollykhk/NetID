# Smart_NetID

## Background
This is the sole winning C# project for the C# workshop final challenge at my school. Submissions only available to workshop attendees. I was competed against estimately 30 attendees. The program was praise by instructors for "submitting an amazing and functional entry". 

## Duration
C# workshop took place every Saturday afternoon for 5 hours. 

## Challenge
I used Java more than C#, so I did think in terms of Java when I programmed.
